Android-Backup-Restore Tool for Linux
Version 0.1

After using all of the backup tools for root, I have ran into random FCs and bugs. This script uses Android SDK's adb tool and was designed
to be simple. This script goes through and backs up your applications, bookmarks, sms, alarm clocks, settings, launcher settings and dictionary.
There are plans for this script to be interactive in the future. As for now, it is a very basic script that will backup your device then restore
your device.

Notes. As for now this script requires sudo. On every other linux pc tested, sudo was required (maybe because user did not install adb correctly?). This
will change in future versions.

REQUIREMENTS
1. Android SDK Toolkit 1.5 or higher
2. Bash v4.0.33
